Permission is hereby granted, to anyone and everyone, dead or alive, 
be it human, alien, sentient platypus or any other ghoulish creature, 
to use, copy, modify, distribute, sublicense, sell, launch into space 
or otherwise abuse this work for any purpose whatsoever, even the one 
your mother would disapprove of. Simplistically put, thou hast naught 
but the right to wield this as thy wilt ordains.

This stuff is provided as-is, without warranty, guarantee, or support 
of any kind. If it breaks, fries your computer, burns down your house, 
triggers a global crisis or irreversible damage to your mental health, 
that's entirely on you. The author bears absolutely no responsibility, 
none whatsoever, so do not come crying. Everyone who complains shall 
be rightfully and mercilessly laughed at for their ignorance.

If, however, this stuff serves you well, you are morally obligated to 
buy me a beer shall we ever meet in person. Furthermore, if you create 
something truly marvelous with this stuff, feel encouraged to tell all 
your friends from whom you obtained it, and perhaps even hold a feast 
in honor of its creator. Share the wealth of knowledge, for thou hast 
been blessed with instruments to craft wonders untold.

But on the other hand, if this stuff ends up being used for calamitous 
intent, you are hereby ordered to erase all traces that could possibly 
lead to the original author. Every shred of evidence, hint, or link to 
the original author must be purged from all memory, burned to ashes, 
obliterated beyond recognition and vaporized into nothingness.

Now vanish, and may your beer always be cold.
